# Simple C# Port Scanning Tool

This is a basic TCP single port scanner written in C#. Saw the code in a [ClearSky Security Report](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ClearSky-Fox-Kitten-Campaign-v1.pdf) on the Fox Kitten campaign. Seemed like a useful tool for port validation before performing lateral movement.
